# sortAlgorithms

In this repository there are the main sort algorithms. They are:
  1) Bubble Sort
  2) Insert Sort
  3) Merge Sort
  4) Naive Sort
  5) Quick Sort
  
With N (number of elements in input):
  1) the Bubble sort algorithm has a complexity:
    1.1) in the best case: O(N)
    1.2) in the worse case: O(N^2/2)
    1.3) in a normal case: betweeen N - 1 and N^2/2
