# sortAlgorithms

In this repository there are the main sort algorithms. They are:
  1) __Bubble Sort__
  2) __Insert Sort__
  3) __Merge Sort__
  4) __Naive Sort__
  5) __Quick Sort__
  
With N (number of elements in input):
  1. the Bubble sort algorithm has a complexity:
      1. in the best case: O(N)
      2. in the worse case: O(N^2/2)
      3. in a normal case: betweeen N - 1 and N^2/2
  2. the Naive sort algorithm has a complexity, __in every case__, of O(N^2/2)
  3. the Insert sort algorithm has a complexity:
      1. in the best case: N - 1
      2. in the worse case: O(N^2/2)
      3. in a normal case: (N - 1) / 2
  4. the Quick sort algorithm has a complexity of O(N log<sub>2</sub>N) and __no algorithm can do better than this value__
  5. the Merge sort algorithn has always a complexity of OO(N log<sub>2</sub>N)
